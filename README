Jasmine - Inotai's data format

Jasmine is basically a nice to read JSON notation, it differs from JSON in several aspects:

- optional coma - list items or object value-pairs do not need to be separated by a comma, new-line is enough
- double quoted strings have some neat new escape sequences
- single quoted strings - for simple strings without the excess of interpretting escape sequences
- un-quoted strings - a.k.a symbols - simple values or keys without quotes are allowed
- regular expressions - they do not need to represented as quoted strings, just the /regexp/options is fine
- more types supported as object pair keys - single, double and unquoted strings as well as numbers

This is a quick port of our C++ implementation, fork away and help us improve. 
Every commit that changes something needs to come with tests though.
